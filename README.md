# ColdWarWordEmbeddings

<h1>The Cold War and Word Embeddings: Exploring Gender in the *FRUS* Series, 1945-1968</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This repository contains the encoding and data for a  word vector model on foreign relations documents from the early Cold War. This respository contains the following elements: <br>

A data folder with one folder containing text documents from *Foreign Relations of the United States* editions on Latin America between 1945-1968; one folder containing text documents from *Foreign Relations of the United States* editions on Europe between 1945-1968; a bin file of one Latin America-related model; and a bin file of one Europe-related model <br>
A jupyter notebook containing the word vector model code, some explanatory information, and information on my data cleaning <br>
A text file used to set the version of R used in a mybinder, which can be found at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ccloutier312/ColdWarWordEmbeddings/49bbeee74fcbdf1e9e30fc6962e8f1332f944bb0

The notebook uses R to perform the code. <br>

<h2>Uses</h2>
This project is intended for scholars new to text analysis to understand the capabilities of word vector analysis and follow along with a step-by-step example. This project is also intended to act as a case study for scholars interested in the digital humanities. 

<h2>Credit</h2>
This project is based on and uses code from the Women Writers Project Rmd file “introduction_word2vec” which uses the "wordVectors" package developed by Ben Schmidt and Jian Li. The file can be found here: https://github.com/NEU-DSG/wwp-public-code-share/blob/master/WordVectors/introduction_word2vec.Rmd. This code has been slightly modified to fit my corpus and research questions. This project was inspired by the “Word Vectors for the Thoughtful Humanist” institute hosted by the Women Writers Project in July 2019. This project is also reliant on the Foreign Relations of the United States series which can be found here: https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/ebooks.
